port most OS socket code into mnet. [x]
 with maybe a mnet_core for functions with a bunch of parameters,
 and some more API like functions with fewer things to mess up on.

higher level API with automatic TCP handling and easier use of UDP. [ ]

try to optimize the sendv/iocvec system , with windows mnet needs to convert the mnet_iovec to
 a windows buffer type, which needs heap and costs time.
 a typedef and util;ity functions could be better suited. [ ]
